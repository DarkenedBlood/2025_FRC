The Program Will Ask You For...

    - The Name of the product you are selling
    - How many you plan on selling
    - The costs for each component of the product
    (variable expenses)
    - Whether or not you have fixed expenses (if you have
    fixed expenses, it will ask you what they are)
    - How much money you want to make (ie; your profit goal)
    - How much the recommended sales price should be rounded to.

The program outputs an itemised list of the variable and fixed
expenses (which includes the subtotals for these expenses)

Finally it will tell you how much you should sell each item
for you to reach your profit goal

The data will be written to a text file which has the same name
as your product and today's date.
